1. ANALYZE MY CODEBASE:
   - First, examine index.html to understand the structure of the web application
   - Review the Index-reference-spec.gemini.json file for detailed documentation
   - Study the current pdfFiles array to understand topic organization
   - Understand the PDF naming convention and how they relate to topics
   - Note that Python scripts will be created/modified but NOT executed automatically

2. RENAME PDF FILES:
   - I have PDF files with complex names (e.g., SG_TopicNameQuiz_67ec67722ed789.pdf) that need to be renamed
   - Create or modify the Python script (rename_pdfs.py) that will:
     a) Map long topic names to topic numbers (e.g., "TopicName" â†’ "1.2")
     b) Preserve type distinctions where SG_ prefix = "answers" and TB_ prefix = "quiz" 
     c) Create a backup of original files before renaming
     d) Handle special cases like progress check files
     e) Use the simplified naming convention: "1.2_quiz.pdf" and "1.2_answers.pdf"
     f) Provide clear reporting on renamed and skipped files
     g) Handle any case-sensitivity issues in filenames
   - NOTE: Do not attempt to execute any Python scripts - I will run them manually

3. UPDATE INDEX.HTML:
   - After creating the rename script, modify the pdfFiles array to:
     a) Update all topic IDs, names, and descriptions based on the target unit
     b) Update PDF file paths to point to the renamed files
     c) Update video URLs using the media-map.md file
     d) Update any unit-specific text throughout the file (titles, headers, etc.)
     e) IMPORTANT: Ensure the correct exam weight percentage is updated (look for the Exam Weight line)
     f) Preserve the same structure and patterns for the pdfFiles array

4. VERIFY CHANGES:
   - Check for any remaining references to the previous unit by:
     a) Suggesting a search pattern for me to run
     b) Reviewing header sections, PDF file paths, and any UI text
     c) Creating a simple verification check to confirm exam weight is properly updated
     d) Ensuring all the renamed PDF files match the paths in the pdfFiles array

Available reference files:
- index-reference-spec.gemini.json: Contains mapping of index.html, explaining all webpage structure
- media-map.md: Contains video URLs for each unit and maps original PDF filenames to topics
- ls-output.txt: Directory listing showing actual PDF filenames
- knowledge-tree.md: Complete topic list for all AP Statistics units

Please work methodically through these tasks one at a time, explaining your approach clearly as you go. If you encounter any issues that require decisions or clarification, please ask.
