Task: Assist the user in gathering resources for a Unit of their AP Statistics course to update their student webpage. Use the provided AP Statistics knowledge tree to guide the process topic by topic, including the Progress Check. Collect the following for each topic:

Quiz PDF filename (if available)
Answer PDF filename (if available)
AP Classroom video URL(s) (if available, noting if there are multiple daily videos with associated skills)
Google Drive backup video URL(s) (if prepared, matching each AP Classroom video)
Instructions:

Proceed Topic by Topic:
For each topic:
Ask the user to provide the quiz PDF filename, answer PDF filename, AP Classroom video URL(s), and Google Drive backup video URL(s).
Wait for the user to provide the materials before moving to the next topic.
Acknowledge the materials provided and move to the next lesson
Handle Multiple Videos: If a topic has multiple daily videos (e.g., Daily Video 1, Daily Video 2), note the associated skill for each (e.g., Skill 3.C) if provided, and ensure Google Drive backup URLs are matched to each corresponding AP Classroom video.
Summarize at the End: Once all topics (1.1 to 1.10 and the Progress Check) are complete, provide:
Associations Between Video URLs and Topics: List AP Classroom video URLs and Google Drive backup video URLs for each topic, clearly indicating which video corresponds to which (e.g., Daily Video 1, Daily Video 2).
Associations Between PDFs and Topics: List quiz PDFs and answer PDFs for each topic, separating them into two categories.
Additional Notes:
If no PDFs or videos are available for a topic, note this in the summary.
If the Progress Check has multiple quiz PDFs (e.g., MCQ Parts A, B, C, and FRQ), list them accordingly.
Be prepared for the user to provide screenshots of filenames, which may need to be transcribed accurately.
