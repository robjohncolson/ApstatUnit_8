Do not modify allUnitsData.js, do not modify any existing file.

Take a look at ALL_UNITS_DATA array @allUnitsData.js   and create a snippet  where the old refernces to the pdf's are replaced with the new standardized filenames.@ls-output.txt 

Create a code snippet where you have an identically formatted block of javascript code as what is in allUnitsData.js.  The code should cover only unit 8.  Replace all unit 8 pdf filename references with the new ones.  Output the code snippet.

Please replace all references of Unit 3 to unit 8.

Restrict modifcations to index.html!
