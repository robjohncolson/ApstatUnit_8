Convert AP Statistics Unit 8 (Inference for Categorical Data: Chi-Square) to Unit 9 (Inference for Quantitative Data: Slopes) by:

1. Replace all "Unit 8" with "Unit 9" in HTML title, headers, and content
2. Keep exam weight at "2-5%" (no change needed)
3. Replace all paths: "pdfs/unit8/8." → "pdfs/unit9/9."
4. Update pdfFiles array:
   - Change id: "8-n" → "9-n" for all topics
   - Change name: "Topic 8.n" → "Topic 9.n"
   - Update descriptions from knowledge-tree.md (Unit 9 topics)
   - Replace video URLs with links from urls-map.md for Unit 9
   - Update quiz PDF paths using pdf-map.txt for Unit 9
   - Update all quiz IDs: "8-n_q1" → "9-n_q1"
5. Update capstone: "8-capstone" → "9-capstone" with correct PDF paths
6. Change localStorage key: "apStatsUnit8TopicProgress" → "apStatsUnit9TopicProgress"

Note: Unit 9 has 6 topics (9.1-9.6) vs. Unit 8's 7 topics - adjust topic count accordingly.

Use these files for reference:
- knowledge-tree.md (Unit 9 topics & descriptions)
- media-map.md (Unit 9 video links & Unit 9 PDF mappings)
- ls-output.txt (directory structure)

Run verify_conversion.py after the change to ensure complete conversion with no references to Unit 8 remaining.
